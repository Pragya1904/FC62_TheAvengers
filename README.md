# Idea
Our idea is to make the whole process of getting the medicine to your doorstep a cakewalk. So, the
question is how? We will create an app through which you can get a list of medical stores near you
and you can simply order medicines through it, instead of you going to all medicine stores in your
area to search for the medicine you need. The app will reduce the time consumed in finding
medicines manually. Also, we donâ€™t need to order medicines from any site and wait long for
the medicine to get delivered.
Also, it will help the small scale business so, that they can reach their customers more efficiently.
Also through this, we will be collecting the data of medicines bought and sold in an area so, we can
create an ML prediction model which can tell us about the kind of disease that can spread at a large
level in a particular area and government can take preventive measures before it becomes a major
issue.



### For the implementation of our idea, we will be using the following tech stack
<ul><li>Flutter for frontend</li>

<li>Firebase for backend</li>

<li>Firestore as database service</li></ul>
