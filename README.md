# Idea
<b>Our idea is to make the whole process of getting the medicine to your doorstep a cakewalk without affecting the local store owners. So, the question is how?</b>
</br> We will create an app through which you can get a list of medical stores near you and you can simply order medicines through it, instead of you going to all medicine stores in your area to search for the medicine you need. The app will reduce the time consumed in finding
medicines manually. Also, we donâ€™t need to order medicines from any site and wait long for
the medicine to get delivered.</br></br>Also, it will help the small scale business so, that they can reach their customers more efficiently.</br></br>Also through this, we will be collecting the data of medicines bought and sold in an area so, we can create an ML prediction model which can tell us   the kind of disease that can spread at a large level in a particular area and government can take preventive measures before it becomes a major issue.
</br></br>Our Delivery System will provide same-day delivery as we will deliver medicines from nearby medical
stores. We will hire our delivery partners to reduce external delivery costs and to hold more
accountability for the medicines being delivered.</br>Our model will promote the local medical stores and will generate employment as we will require delivery persons for delivery.
</br></br><b>Our product is also a strong voice for the small local brick-and-mortar stores that are being crushed by various e-commerce giants.
